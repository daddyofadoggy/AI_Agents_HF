## Agentic AI Projects (Using Smolagent Framework)

- Multi-Agent Orchestration System: Built a multi-agent pipeline using Hugging Faceâ€™s smolagents framework, where a Manager Agent coordinates a Code Interpreter Agent and Web Search Agents using tools like DuckDuckGoSearchTool and VisitWebpageTool for dynamic code execution and online retrieval. Powered by the Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct LLM via Hugging Face Inference API.

- Agentic RAG System: Developed a retrieval-augmented generation agent using smolagents, featuring a BM25 retriever over Hugging Face docs and optional web fallback. Enabled multi-step reasoning with HyDE-style hypothesis generation and answer refinement. Integrated with Qwen-series LLMs via the Inference API for grounded, transparent output.
